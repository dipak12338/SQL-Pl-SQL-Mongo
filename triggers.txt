TRIGGERS:
---------

A database trigger is a PL/SQL block or a PL/SQL procedure associated with a table, view, schema, or the database.

It gets implicitly executed when some database-related event occurs.
Can be applied before the instruction is executed as well as after the execution.

Types of Triggers:
---------------------
Application Triggers	:	Fires whenever an event occurs with a particular application
And
Database triggers		:	Fires whenever a data event (such as DML on a table, view) or DDL(such as create, alter) or system event(such as logon, shutdown) occurs.

Exaples:
SQL> CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER secure_emp
BEFORE INSERT 
ON EMPLOYEE
BEGIN 
IF (TO_CHAR(SYSDATE,'DY') = ('SAT','SUN')) OR (TO_CHAR(SYSDATE,'HH24:MI') NOT BETWEEN '08:00' AND '18:00') THEN
Raise_application_Error (-20500,'You may insert only during business hours’);
END IF;
END;


The above trigger will not insert data into table during holidays. Ex. Saturday and Sunday. 
If added then it will raise exception based on DML commands.


----------------

SQL> Create or replace trigger secure_emp
before insert or update or delete on Employee
begin
if (to_char(sysdate,'DY') in ('SAT','SUN’)) Then
If INSERTING Then
Raise_application_error(-20502,'you may insert only during business working days’);
ELSIf DELETING Then
Raise_application_error(-20503,'you may delete only during business working days’);
ELSIf UPDATING('salary') Then
Raise_application_error(-20504,'you may update salary only during business working days’);
Else 
Raise_application_error(-20505,'you may update data only during business working days’);
End if;
End if;
end;
